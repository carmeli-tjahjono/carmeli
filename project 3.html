									<p> My first SQL project where I worked through the 10 questions in this case study.
									<br> Read about the challenge here <a href="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/" class="action">Dannys Diner</a>

									<p>Case Study Questions:
									<p>1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant? 
									<br>2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
									<br>3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
									<br>4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
									<br>5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
									<br>6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
									<br>7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
									<br>8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
									<br>9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
									<br>10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
